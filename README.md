# The Algernon Sequitur
## Adventure game prototype made with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), [Krita](https://krita.org/), [Ardour](https://ardour.org/), and [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) (via [inkgd](https://github.com/ephread/inkgd))



This is a rough prototype example for interactive fiction / adventure games using open-source software and Creative Commons / public domain assets. I wanted to try out a simple framework for story-driven games using all FOSS pipelines in Linux, so I started this little 2 scene project. It uses a blend of top-down and side-scroller perpectives. The control scheme and interaction logic were designed primarily with controller in mind so the point and click mechanics aren't ideal.

This is my first time working on anything resembling an actual project, and I've essentially been using it as a central repository to dump my experiments while I attempt to learn the various pipelines of game dev; as a result, the whole thing is gauranteed to be messy, inefficient, full of odd choices & poorly documented. Having said that, if someone interested in making adventure games begins taking their first steps in Godot and happens to find their way here, I'd like to think they might find a few ideas helpful for getting started.
